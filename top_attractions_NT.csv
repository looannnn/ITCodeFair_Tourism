Tourist attractions,Great fun and kids had a ball. Need around 2-3 ours depending on how much you want to do!,5,2025-05,29/05/2025,"We visited Crocosaurus Cove in May 2025.

Kids had fun especially with the big croc feeding and fishing for crocs which follows straight on after. 
The fish feeding was so so for us.... more an educational talk and can't really see too much

Can hold a baby croc for a phot that has to be purchased...... they are pretty strict on not taking your own photos with your phone etc.

We also had a lunch time show on where a python was fed a (dead) rat and they kids got to hold a snake and lizard after. 

My wife and I also did the cage of death which was fun! Would never get that up close to a big croc otherwise! The crocs are massive!

Overall I think 2-3 hours is plenty of time depending on what shows / talks you want to go to!

Food is what you expect for a place like this..... kids got nuggets and chips etc but you can also get a pass out if you wanted to go out and get food and come back!

Don't miss the ""big croc"" show where the big crocs get fed. You won't forget the sound of the snapping of their massive jaws.

Message to Crocosaurus: With the goggles, you can duck down under the water in the cage to see the croc's belly. But it is hard to stay down, because your body wants to float.

Tourist attractions,"See you later, Alligator",5,2025-03,3/04/2025,"I left Crocosaurus Cove until the last day in Darwin, because I thought it might be a bit of a tourist trap. I was wrong... or right I guess. It might be a tourist trap but this should be on everyones list to see. It's amazing... let me say that again... A-MAZ-ing! I paid my fare to the staff- who were very professional. I went inside expecting to see a few crocodiles... it's so much more. It takes you on a journey so you can understand the different between Alligators and Crocodiles-- then explains the differences in the crocodiles around the world. It will then tell you reason after reason why these reptiles are unique. 

But then there's more... YES- you guessed it- there are steak knives! No seriously... handbags.. well in the making. Okay.. .seriously this time! They have the most amazing range of other critters to show you. I loved the reptile enclosure so much that I visited it twice... clearly I was there at the right time because I was dancing with snakes and having deep and meaningful conversations with lizards. Well... that's how I saw it... the reptiles might tell you another story... but they are lying... ha ha. 

There was a young lady called Annabelle who answered most of my silly questions. Thank you Annabelle. I asked her about Wendell... about his missing foot, she explained to me that crocodiles can lose their limbs and survive! They can lose their jaw and survive, but if that tail gets damaged-- it's all over, red rover! 

As if that wasn't fascinating enough, Annabelle then told me about the two crocodiles in the same enclosure. She is about 70, he is about 50 and they are happily in a relationship... not a situational ship... this is the real thing. That means she is a cougar. Yes, I am impressed! 

Another young lady let me pat a crocodile - yes of course its mouth was taped! Still... I was allowed to pet it. And then another lady offered me a children's snake... er... that would be a no but the blue-tongue lizard was a yes... so I held that. And let me tell you if size counted ( and ladies we know it does) then... you should be impressed by the size of their lizards in the Northern Territory. 

I can't say it enough... this place is AMAZING!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255066-d1627688-r1000886354-Crocosaurus_Cove-Darwin_Top_End_Northern_Territory.html,2767,105472,"Gippsland, Australia",Gippsland,Darwin,Australia,800,Northern Territory,58 Mitchell Street,Corner of Mitchell & Peel Streets,"Darwin, Top End, Northern Territory",Crocosaurus Cove,3476,4.3,102,109,336,1118,1811

i have the same element of debate in my mind at any type of zoo, wondering about the welfare of whatever captive i'm viewing. and in this case be it goanna, snake or crocodile, i'm sufficiently impressed to put those moral dilemmas to one side.

We purchased a VIP tour which we enjoyed. My 8 and 9 year old boys dislike the heat and were irritable when walking around prior to the tour commencing. 
The thoughtful guide gave us each a bottle of chilled water and we started the tour in an air conditioned room looking at models and skeletons of crocs. Then we all got to hold a baby croc (with mouth taped shut). 
Next stop was to feed kangaroo meat to small to medium size crocs (one turn each).
Then we got to meet Burt, a huge croc with one eye and one missing leg and each got to feed him too. 
The last stop was the reptile house where we got to hold a skink and a python and pat a Monitor lizard.
The guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic (she loves Orcas, but I can’t recall her name).
For us this was a great opportunity to experience something different in an intimate group (max 8 people). 
Our boys did not last to see the shows(!) so I can’t compare the VIP experience with the shows but the hands on component of the VIP experience was wonderful and managed to keep my boys from whinging about the hot weather for almost its entire 1.5 hour duration!

It has big, old croc's, whose stories are much enlivened if you do one of the many, regular, short guided tours.  (Make sure to ask about the croc couple, Will & Kate.)  There’s also a snake & lizard exhibition that’s well worth doing – and it’s air-conditioned :-)  Also a giant fish tank with lots of interesting critters swimming around each other.  

Want to hold a small croc?  No problem, go to the photography area on the 1st floor in the Reptile House.  (Incidentally, that photographer is fun to watch as he deals with the shy & the scared, people trying to clown around, people he effortlessly teaches to do interesting poses for the photo’s, & all while the croc’s are trying to wiggle while being held.  Despite everything going on, he produces absolutely terrific pic’s that are amazing & memorable.  Top points for photographic competence & for dealing super nicely with people.)

Tourist attractions,Virtual Reality,5,2025-03,1/04/2025,"This was highly recommended by the staff at the Information Centre, so it became my first stop on the Hop On/Hop Off bus. It is located at Pier 2 which is famous for a few reasons... this is where 'Australia' was filmed ... and also where the bombing occurred in 1942. 

When you walk into the facility you are very warmly greeted by staff. They greet and then direct you to stand on a pad when the siren alarm goes off. The pad you stand on has a huge screen in front of it, and from here you will get a first hand account of that fateful day in 1942 witnessing what if would have been like (to a lesser degree). The experience is quite impressive... you will see the water being disturbed, the smoke, the aircraft and hear the noise. 

From here they direct you into a theatre room to watch two documentaries. I watched one then went to explore the facility before returning later to watch the second one... both were exceptional. 

There is much to read, but the experiences are very immersive as they use virtual reality headsets both for the Royal Flying Doctors area and the area for WW2. I climbed onto the aircraft and walked through it to understand the small spaces that the staff on board have to work in. 

The facility has an aircraft hanging near the foyer, there are information boards everywhere and there is a gift store here as well (once again, with amazing staff).

Allow up to 2hrs to experience it properly. My whole family enjoyed it, and all ages would too. There’s lots of fun things to see and do here, to keep young kids both educated and entertained.

Talking about both the history of the RFDS and the WWII bombing of Darwin, this attraction’s advanced technology and imagery is amazing. Enjoy wearing virtual reality (VR) headsets, to learn about the bombing of Darwin, plus the RFDS from both the pilot and patient’s points of view. 

Enjoy two short movies about both in the cinema with hologram imagery.

Stand in front of the huge curved LED screen, watching an image of Darwin Harbour as it is now. Wait to hear the air sirens go off, then the peaceful Darwin Harbour scene changes to it being attacked by bombers during WWII, with lots of special effects.

Walk around to read about Darwin’s history on the walls, and hear stories from John Flynn (the RFDS founder), and a Japanese WWII bomber pilot via their projected hologram images.

And climb aboard an actual RFDS aircraft, to get an appreciation for its tight quarters, patient treatment area and the cockpit.

We also found the Royal Flying Doctor Service display very interesting. We have been watching the RFDS TV series and you don’t appreciate the tight confines the doctors and nurses work in until you go into the plane they have in the museum.

I had no idea when I arrived here that this would tie all of the information I learned from the area together ... and so much more! 

If you want to learn about Darwin... Northern Territory... then you simply must visit. This is great for anyone- all ages. 

I found the most amazing photography exhibit not too long after wandering in... it gave you insight into the men who recorded the events of the war. From there I walked into a room that was all about the creepy stuff... you know, insects, spiders and such. I was delighted with the first two exhibits, but then you wander into another room that has exhibits and information about Cyclone Tracy- including the car that made headlines and the rag doll that was photographed and used in papers around the world. 

But you know how this goes... there's more. Let's upsize this - fries & large coke please! The next exhibit was beautifully presented with information about the history of the fauna and flora. Another room followed with Year 12 art work. Then upstairs to read about the indigenous people of the area. Another room followed called Unruly Days and that too was fascinating. A large room full of boats and then the stuffed creatures along the entry/exit area. I thought I was satiated with information but then I realised there is a theatre room and that was running movies about Cyclone Tracy.

From memory they have the unbelievably huge B52, the F18, F111, P3 Orion, Mirage, Spitfire, Sabre, a Cobra helicopter, Wessex helicopter, and this would be less than a tenth of the lineup.

The information is great, and they provide the opportunity to see into some of the more fascinating areas - eg. the gunner area of a Lancaster Bomber (I'm too big and won't fit!!) 

Definitely worth a visit (AUD$20) adult and $15 for seniors and service people (July 2024).  As a bonus the outside of the museum is at the end of the runway for the airport where amazing military and civilian aircraft take off.

Would still recommend going for the experience and the sunset view from the beach, but just don't have high expectations, of course it is free with a cheep or free for Aus seniors bus from the city.

There is a reminder that no glass glass, alcohol, BBQs, skateboards, camping or littering permitted... pets are allowed on a leash... management has the right to remove patrons from the precinct. How interesting... it's quite plastic fantastic. 

Whilst part of me enjoys knowing the area is safe with perfect facilities ( bathrooms, recreation lagoon, wave lagoon, cafes, restaurants) the other side of me found this sterile and lacking soul. 

The Waterfront Precinct is built on reclaimed land from Kitchener Bay between Stokes Hill and Fort Hill (which has since been removed). The only bit that appealed to me was the Darwin Oil Storage Tunnels... that were built to protect the navy's oil from the Japanese... AND these predated the area being created.

From the city the waterfront was accessible easily on an elevated pedestrian walkway which was well protected by a roof so that one would not get drenched during bad weather conditions. Access was well illuminated in the night with an elevator to get to the ground level. There were some beautiful sculptures of ""Jipijonton"" or ""Jabiru"" birds, paintings and real palms decorating this area which was connected to the dining and shopping precinct of the waterfront. Well surfaced pathways meandering through the area led us across the park area to the Wave Lagoon, Recreational Lagoon and the Darwin convention centre. The convention centre was an attractive building which was elegantly lit up with hues of blue in the night. Wave Lagoon was very popular with tourists and in a warm day the pool was a great comforter that was filled with fun. Adjoining the Lagoon were several breakwater piers creating some calmer water basins where we observed an Aquapark with sports activity being offered. In the same neighbourhood there were jet ski or water scooters, tour boats and the Stokes Hill wharf where we were able to enjoy the harbour views, watch sailing ships, boats and birds with dining facilities.

There was a lovely fountain nearby which also ceased functioning about the same time. We walk to the visitor centre which had no staff or maps apart from those on boards. Most of the plants weren't labelled and the signposts not clear in directing you and many areas were in disrepair. We were interested in the tropical rainforest and the map showed a circular route through the forest but in fact it was only a short boardwalk of about 20 m going through the rainforest. On our way out we did find a collection of Boab trees from different countries which was very interesting. Some reviews  were more positive.

Tourist attractions,"Incredible, beautiful, a must-see attraction in Alice Springs",5,2024-04,24/05/2024,"This was honestly amazing, and I'd say if you go to Alice Springs you really have to come visit the park.

It's in beautiful surrounds, near town and easy to get to but far enough into the bush that it feels isolate and natural. Sitting right up against Tjoritja/the West MacDonnell range, it's a lovely spot to be.

First, we went to watch the (free) bird show, which I'd highly recommend. They have lots of birds fly through the stands, over your heads, and teach us about birds commonly found in Central Australia. While we were there, Sophie and Angus ran the bird show, and did a fantastic job. The falcon and wedge-tailed eagle were particular favourites, and I got to get a photo with a snowy owl perched on my hand after the show which was super cool. They charge a small fee ($10) to get a photo with the birds afterwards, which I though was more than worth it and a great way to give back to such a meaningful place.

We then walked around the park and saw most of the exhibits. Seeing the emus up close was great (they're huge!), but my personal favourite was the bird enclosures. The park is filled with small buildings attached to large outdoor enclosed areas, and you go throuhg a set of double doors to get in and see the birds. When you walk in, it's quiet and you'd think it was empty, but if you sit quitely for a few minutes all the birds come out and walk, fly, and sing around their little home, it's amazing.

I couldn't recommend this more highly, I had a blast.

The next tour was in the amphitheatre watching the birds - quite interesting, then an aboriginal lady taught us about preparing of seeds, and weapons and tools that they use in the bush.. so interesting.  The atmosphere in the park is great.. a little hard to work out where each meeting point is for the next tour, but then i'm hopeless with maps.  Had lunch in the cafe which was pleasant but average food.. certainly better than some cafes in Alice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255063-d256785-r951276436-Alice_Springs_Desert_Park-Alice_Springs_Red_Centre_Northern_Territory.html,0,24,,,Alice Springs,Australia,870,Northern Territory,Larapinta Drive,Desert Park Entrance Road,"Alice Springs, Red Centre, Northern Territory",Alice Springs Desert Park,2113,4.6,19,36,100,499,1459

We had a group of about 12 people and all wore red lights on our heads to guide us and spot animals. We walked through a predator proof enclosure but it felt like we were walking through the desert at nighttime. We saw several gorgeous and very friendly echindas, Bilby, Marlas, stick rats and several other cute little animals I have forgotten the name of. It was a magical experience and I recommend this to all animal lovers.

The park is well laid out and the rangers are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. You learn a lot about the animals and plants, including about bush food and medicine.  The highlight for me though was the birds of prey display/demo.  It was exceptional – incredible raptor birds for the most part but the interaction was a real experience.  The ranger who took the show was funny and entertaining and full of great information on each bird.  I could not recommend this show more highly.  I also loved the nocturnal area.  To be able to see these animals in as natural as surrounding as possible indoors and for them to go about their life without knowledge of you was awesome.  To get to see a bilby bopping around was the highlight, and on the Eater weekend.  If you get the chance to be in Alice, do yourself a favour and visit the Desert Park.

The holiday was planned and arranged well over a year ago and I just awaited final confirmation of our tour booking.  I was thoroughly disappointed when several weeks ago my local travel agent told me the sanctuary had decided to close when we planned to visit.  On hearing this we moved all of our holiday forward, with incurred costs, to enable us to visit at the end of August before the September closure.  I was thrilled when the booking period opened for May onwards and our travel agent was able to secure a booking.  To our further disappointment we are now informed that our accepted booking has been cancelled, with no reason given, and now there is no other time available for us to visit and we have the incurred cost for the change of holiday dates.

After a talk and getting to know where, in our case very multinational, we had come from he introduced to the two babies he is currently mothering. We were then went into the none release sanctuary area via the tin hut that used to be where he lived. Everyone was given a chance to carry one of the babies in its pillowcase (don’t actually touch them tho). He knows all the names and histories of all the roos in that closure.

Don’t waste your time trying to do that.,1,2025-04,4/04/2025,"If you’re expecting to drive to Cathrine gorge and have a look at it from a look out point, well, you can’t.  Very disappointing to say the least. First there is no park gate and no place to pay for park entry. Then there is a maze of parking lots and you can’t figure out where the look out point might be. I mean we all go there for one thing - to see the Gorge. You would think that there would be a clear sign “View Point > “. Ended up at a restaurant and asked where to pay and where the look out point was. She gave me a web site to go to get a park pass. You can only get it on line there is no cell service there but I signed into restaurant wi-fi. So after 20 minutes of frustration- at no point of sign in and registration and phone number and rejected pass words - never did I find a point where I could pay the park fee - so I just said screw this and went on (I am a tourist and will never be back so all this on line registration was pointless). We looked for a place to see the gorge but finally, after driving in circles, ended up at the boat ramp. Of course it is a restricted area so you can’t go down to where the boat tours launch and even if you could, foliage makes it so you can’t see anything. We did find a map for a 1 km walking trail up a cliff stairway to a look out point, but with one of us being 70, and very hot out, we decided that it was all a waste of time and energy. If you happen to know the obscure trail name, and see the little cloud on the map that states viewing  platform, well you have worked out the secret view point location, but THERE IS NO VIEW POINT YOU CAN DRIVE TO SO FORGET THAT - YOU CAN NOT DO THAT THERE. No wheel chair or elderly access and organized very poorly. It’s like they are in the dark as to why people come there. Don’t waste your time going there.

They actually aren't Springs but a large and beautiful waterhole... loved sitting by its edge, watching children playing on the rocks and near the water.  Beautiful place.

Tourist attractions,Fantabulous experience at Katherine gorge,5,2024-06,18/11/2024,"It was a discovery of the canyons created along the route taken by the Katherine River over the centuries. The boat tour to appreciate the gorge was an excellent experience as this metal bodied flat bottom boat was able to cruise almost silently like it was gliding on still water. Water appeared to be somewhat greenish tinted and rather stagnant than flowing. Operator of the boat gave a running commentary and showed many freshwater crocodiles who have come out perhaps for sun bathing. The specimens we saw were small to medium even though we were told that they could be a decade or more by age. We passed a few beautiful beaches where the sand has settled beautifully sloping towards the river. We were told that these are common egg laying areas of the Crocodiles. While they were predators, they too became probable victims to other predators and even to cannibalistic bigger Crocodiles while they were small. 

Due to the dry weather the river has become segmented with each segment formed like a lake, each having a topographical difference but inter connected with a very small over flow to the next. With this phenomenon the first cruise ended at one point and we walked on rocky banks to the next level to board another boat. At this point we were delighted to see many of the aboriginal rock art on a cliffside which were supposed to be several thousand years old. There were hand prints, human and animal figures all in reddish colour. It was interesting to learn how the pre-historic dwellers mixed colours obtaining colours from plant material, crushed rock minerals and then mixing them with clay to use that to paint. Higher the images older they were! 

 It was a very interesting experience to see the rugged Katherine Gorge with various curious rock formations, deep narrow crevices, caves and deep rock holes. We learnt a lot from the young skipper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g256203-d256780-r980931562-Nitmiluk_National_Park-Katherine_Top_End_Northern_Territory.html,148,11180,"Byron Bay, Australia",Byron Bay,Katherine,Australia,,Northern Territory,,,"Katherine, Top End, Northern Territory",Nitmiluk National Park,401,4.6,3,9,12,107,270

I found looking at the maps like looking at scrambled eggs, they are a mixture of bike tracks walking tracks all mixed together making no sense, the bike tracks are blue looking like a river. If I had taken time to download the app it would have been easier. The tracks are indigenous names so it makes it even harder to work out for most people. Did the southern rockhole and pats look out, it’s about 800m down stairs and lots of rock climbing to get to the bottom and takes it out of you in the heat, passed a big rock pool near the bottom then to the river with a nice sand bank and trees, well worth the effort but you can’t swim hear. Walked to Jeddas rock then to butterfly gorge, it’s only about 1.5 klms in but seems take for ever, nice and cool near the bottom. Had a refreshing swim for 20 minutes sharing with a handful of other walkers. After a long hot walk it really helped to cool off for the march out to the car. It was a good walk but don’t like walking on wide road tracks on the way out maybe 6klm or more, it was a lot of walking near the road back to the boat ramp car park.

I tour sono solo in inglese, si può accedere solo con la guida.
Consigliata la prenotazione, poiché i gruppi non possono essere troppo numerosi.
A differenza di altre gite in altre grotte, queste sono piuttosto buie quindi si sconsigliano a chi soffre di claustrofobia o a paura dei luoghi scarsamente illuminati.

You could have easily driven it in an AWD like a Subaru Outback, but a standard road car wouldn’t have liked a few patches of corrugation and some unexpectedly deep washes.

Having said that, I’d strongly advise a proper 4WD with tyres designed for lots of stones etc.

The road surface was pretty even for an unpaved road. I have driven similar roads in a 2WD. I do not suggest you do this as conditions change with the season and the weather.

Olive Pink was a prominent figure in Alice Springs from, roughly, 1946 until her death in 1975. She was an Australian Botanical Illustrator, Anthropologist, Gardener and activist for Aboriginal Rights. She seemed to be equally loved by people and not very well liked. The governments at the time found her to be a real nuisance while pushing her various causes. In 1955 she applied for a reservation of about 20 hectares of land to be used as a flora reserve now named after her. The gardens now have a cafe which is recognised as the best in Alice Springs and there are a number of tracks you can take for a walk around, there is heaps of information on the paths along the way about the various plants in each particular area.Taking the Wattle Walk the Eucalyptus perfume was really strong and there were so many birds, I am sure bird watchers would like it here.
